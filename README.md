# serverless-quiz

This is a basic demonstration of some simple AWS serverless use cases.

Disclaimer: Some of the implementations may differ from common best practices, e.g. polling the current highscore vs. working with websockets or inlining all CSS and Javascript in the HTML-file. This is mainly due to the focus of the presentation, which is demonstrating easy-to-use AWS services and not overcomplicating it.
