# serverless-quiz

This is a basic demonstration of some simple AWS serverless use cases.

Disclaimer: Some of the implementations may differ from common best practices, e.g. polling the current highscore vs. working with websockets. This is mainly due to the focus of the presentation, which is demonstrating easy-to-use AWS services and not overcomplicating it.
